### **Background** 

There's an initiative by St. Vincent de Paul of Lane County to create a mobile-home production line. As this is the first of it's kind, I'm curious about its pontential to be a model for future social enterpreneuirship.

> If it's not charity, then why aren't these mobile homes being produced by a for-profit firm?

### **Potential Angles** (So what?)
- **Efficiency**: There's this question how efficient they can be compared to a profit-maximizing firm.[^1]
- **Benefit of Labor**: There's also this question about the value associated with who they employ. For instance perhaps they are more likely to draw from disadvantage backgrounds. 
- **Demand-Side**: There's also this question of whether this supply-side intervention is more effective than a demand-side intervention 

### **To-Do**
- Will call State Rep. Pam Marsh for her perspective
