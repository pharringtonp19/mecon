### Importance

Economics is often characterized as the study of tradeoffs. Often these tradeoffs occur over time. For instance the benefit of some decision may happen in the present but the costs won't be realized until the future. We all understand this idea intuitively. Because the costs occur in the future, we generally aren't certain what value they will take. For instance, if you don't attend class, you don't read the notes, then odds are, you won't do well on the midterm. But what are those odds? To represent this uncertainty, we turn to **[probability theory](./../../math/probability_intro.md)**. 



### Important Aspect

There are many important aspects of probability theory, but arguably the most important part to understand is the notion of a **random variable**. As perhaps you have heard before, a random variable is neither "random" nor is it a variable. Rather, as we depict below, it is simply a function.[^1]

$$X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$$

Thinking of a random variable as a function will be helpful for two reasons: 

1) You'll better understand the essenence of a random variable (it "pulls" the probability distribution forward)

2) It will be straightforward to understand how we can compose random variables (because we'll just be composing functions!)
