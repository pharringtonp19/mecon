### **Introduction** 

Probably the first thing you were introduced to in your Principle of Microeconomics course was the demand function. And presumably, one of the many things that was stressed in that class were the factors of demand and their influence on the demand function. In this lecture, we want to go under the hood -so to say- and model how this. 

### **Heterogeneity**

??? question inline end 

    Can you list the ways in which consumers constraints and preference differ 

One of the attractive or nice features of our modeling approach is that it will be straightforward to incorporate heterogeneity into our demand function. By heterogeneity, we mean that individuals differ both in terms of the **constraints** that they face as well as in their **preferences** (or utility function) and we would like to capture this in model of demand.

We'll represent the heterogeneity by via a random variable, $Z$ that maps into the parameter space. That is given an $\omega \in \Omega$, and $Z: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^p$, we have a parameter $Z(\omega) \in \mathbb{R}^p$. Given this parameter  -->
