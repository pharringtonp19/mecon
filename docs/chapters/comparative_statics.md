### **Introduction**

Once we have a model, such as consumer demand, it's natural to use the model to think about how certain factors affect demand. This exercise is referred to as comparative statics. We change a parameter, such as income, and we want to understand how demand changes. 

Below we highlight how the optimal choice problem changes as we increase income.

This relationship is an implicit function whose graph we depict below.
