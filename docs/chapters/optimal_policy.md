In the previous lecture, we discussed how if we had a suitable model, then we could examine the effects or consequences of a policy. We walked through two short examples of this, illustrating the impact of taxes on equilibrium price and quantity, as well as the effect of income on the optimal choice. 

In this lecture, we take the next step and introduce the structure that will enable us to write down the optimal policy program. As you will see, there's actually very little new in this structure. 

$$\underset{z}{\text{maximize}} \ f(z, x^*(z))$$
