- We can solve for the root of a function by 

### Composing Functions on the Matrix
- We can solve the root of a linear function by composing several functions together (weighted permutation matrices). If you have done gaussian elimination in your linear algebra class, this is what's happening. 

### Composing Functions on the parameters of interest
