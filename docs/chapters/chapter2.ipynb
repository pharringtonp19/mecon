    "Like very few people who I interact with on a daily basis, I find the NBA offseason exilarating. As I am writing this sentence now in early July, Kevin Durant's future is still up in the air. Will he stay in Brooklyn? Will he stay with Kyrie? Could he possibly end up with the team up North? I find the inherent uncertainty of this event exciting. It gives plausibility to the thought of seeing Kevin Durant run pick-in-rolls with Ja Morant, or stretching the court with another long wing in Brandom Ingram.\n",

    "### **Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "When people look at how difficult a topic is to learn, they might start by considering the number of elements in the topic. I might be wrong about this, but I believe this rough heuristic shapes how many people teach classes on statistics and probability. If you can reduce the number of ideas that a student has to consider the easier it should be to learn, i.e. the less overwhelmed they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "I buy the point that it's important to introduce material in a way so as to decrease the likelihood of overwhelming students (that's why we're starting so early in the semester with probability - we're going to introduce it piece by piece), but I would push back on the idea that having fewer elements to learn makes the topic easier to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning a new topic can be difficult for the following three reasons. (1) It can be hard to understand why you should care about the topic (2) It can be hard to understand which aspects of the topic are important and which are just details and (3) It can be hard to understand how the components of the topic fit together. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this understanding in mind, I believe introducing additional components can be helpful it if enables students to better compose ideas. That is, if the addition details allows students to better understand how ideas relate to each others. I think this is the key to understanding probability theory. Understanding the fundamentals will make it easier/ simpler to see how things relate to each other. If you never understand the fundamentals you'll simply have a collection of ideas in your head, which will be harder to keep track of and harder to work with in practice. "
