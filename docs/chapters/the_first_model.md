!!! tldr "Overview"

    The aim of this chapter is to illustrate how economic models can be used to understand, explain and assess economic issues/policies.

### **Economics**

??? cite inline end "Partial Understanding"
    Many people have written about the relationship between Economics and the "hard" sciences. While both strive to adhere to the scientific approach, it should be understood that Economic analyses fall well short of this. In Economics, you generally cannot test precise hypotheses without making unsupported assumptions. -- Read [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/opinion/yes-economics-is-a-science.html) by Raj Chetty for an alternative take though)

Economics is the study of relationships that exists within the economy (relationships between the government and the consumer, between the consumer and the firm, between a consumer today and a consumer in the future - to name a few). Our understanding of these relationships is **partial**. In part, because these relationships change over time, and in part because we cannot run an unlimited number of experiments to study these relationships (often, we cannot perform a single experiment to study the relationship of interest). 

### **Constructing a Model**
Can you construct a model to help you understand an some Economic relationship?

We'll yes and no. To start with, in order to build a model you need to have some understanding of the issue/topic of interest so as to determine which aspects of reality don't need to be faithfully captured by the model. But in addition to that, an Economic model without any data is simply the the result of composing several of your own ideas together. So, does it help you understand an Economic reality, or does the act of creating a model help you better understand your own thoughts on the Economic reality?

### **Discussion**

Hal writes in his textbook of the following two principles:
    
- **The Optimization Principle**: People try tp choose the best patterns of consumption that they can afford.
- **The Equilibrium Principle**: Prices adjust until the amount that people demand of something is equal to the amount that is supplied

To what extent is the second principle redundant? Could the first principle be made more general?

### **Where Supply Meets Demand**

    A model's power stems from the elimination of irrelevant detail, which allows the economist to focus on the essential features of the economic reality he or she is attempting to understand 

Let's say that we're back in the Spring of 2020 and that we're working for Petco, a company that produces dog food. Our manager comes to us and asks us to model how a shutdown for several months might affect the dog food market.

- **Understand**: Prior to the spring of 2022, we might not ever considered how a partial shutdown of society might affect aspects of the economy. To tackle this question we're going to use a model to "work through" what might happen.

- **Communicate**: Our model will also be a way in which we can communicate our beliefs to others. 

- **Assess**: Our manager might come back to usk to "simulate" how one firm policy might fare compared to another. For instance, they might ask us to determine whether they should shut down some of the production sites.

Let's start with understanding how a partial shutdown might affect things. There'e the demand for dog food -- how much people are willing to pay for it at a given price, and the supply of dog food -- how much firms are willing to produce at a given price. We can represent these two notions succinctly with a [function](./../../math/function).
