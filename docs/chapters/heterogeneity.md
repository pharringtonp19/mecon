### **Motivation**

As I've mentioned in class a few times, modeling is more of an art than a science. As such, one important question that you'll want to consider when writing down a model is at what level of detail to model the relationship(s) of interest. 

In many ways, your Principles of Macroeconomic course was the highest level of abstraction. The models you worked with consisted of "Aggregate Demand" and "Aggregate Supply". There was no consideration of the individual. You were concerned with capturing the economy as a whole. In this lecture, we want to consider the other end of the spectrum. How we might capture the fact that individuals differ both in terms of their **constraints** and their **preferences**. 

### **(Un)Observed Heterogeneity**

We'll want to think about whether the differences across consumers are observed by firms.
