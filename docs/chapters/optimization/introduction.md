# **Choice**

A central focus in this class will be designing economic optimization problems. That is, for a given question of interest, we'll want to decide on an appropriate objective function, constraint function and choice variables. The task of actually solving the optimization problem (searching for a value of the choice variable that is feasible and whose value is the lowest when evaluate by the objective function) is actually an engineering problem. There's no real economics involved.


$$\underset{x \in F^{-1}(0)}{\textrm{minimize}} \ f(x)$$

- Choice Variable : $x \in \mathcal{R}^n$ 
- Objective Function:  $f: \mathcal{R}^n \to \mathcal{R}$
- Constraint Function: $F : \mathcal{R}^n \to \{0,1\}$
