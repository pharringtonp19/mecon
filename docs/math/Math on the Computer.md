Hopefully, I've highlighted that writing math on the computer is nothing to sweat over. It may not be obvious though why we want to write math on the computer. Why not stick to pen/pencil and paper? There are two reasons. First writing math on the computer allows us to work at different levels of abstraction. Second its easier to play with your model if its written on the computer. You can change one aspect with one key stroke and see how your predictions change.
