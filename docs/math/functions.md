    In the context of working on a computer, a function that behaves like a mathematical function is called a "pure function"

A function is a mapping that takes a value as an input and returns a value as an output. 

$$\begin{align*}x \in \mathcal{X}, \quad x \overset{f}{\longmapsto} f(x), \quad \textrm{where} \ f(x)  \in \mathcal{Y} \end{align*}$$
 

 This has more detail than I will normally provide when I write down a function in lecture but it's helpful to see the distinct components: 

- $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ are sets[^1] called the domain and codomain respectively
- $x$ is an element of $\mathcal{X}$ and is the input to the function
- $f(x)$ is the output, also referred to as the image of $x$ under $f$ 
- $f$ is the function which maps all of the elements of $\mathcal{X}$ into $\mathcal{Y}$ such that for each $x$ there is only one $y$. We can partially define a function as follows. This tells us the domain and codomain of the function.

$$\begin{align*} f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y} \end{align*}$$




[^1]: a set can be loosley understood as a collection of things.
