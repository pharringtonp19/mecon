A function is a mapping. That is, it takes some value as an input and returns that value as an output). 
 $$x  \overset{f}{\longmapsto} f(x)$$
 This has more detail than you will normally see, but it's helpful to see the three distinct components: 
- $x$ is the input to the function 
- $f$ is the function (i.e. the map which is often represented as an arrow)
- $f(x)$ is the output, also referred to as the image of $x$ under $f$ 
At a high level, functions take values in a given set and return values in another set, which we can denote by the following:
$$f : R^n \to R^m $$

??? tip "Math on the Computer"
    In math, we a function maps from one set into another. When working with functions on a computer, though, we usually think of them as mapping types into types.
