### **Riemann Integral**

From calculus1, we know what the following symbols represent 

$$\int _a ^ b f(x) dx$$

That is, we know how to compute the Riemann integral over an interval. 

$$\int _a ^ b f(x) dx = \underset{\Delta x_i \to 0}{\lim} \sum f(x_i) \Delta x_i $$

### **Abstract Integration**
Given a measurable space and a measurable function, 
$$\big(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu \big), \quad f: \Omega \to [0, \infty]$$

We would like to integrate a measurable function over a measurable set with respect to some measure: 

$$\int _A fd\mu, \quad A \in \mathcal{F} $$

$$\text{Abstract Integration} :: \text{Event} \to \text{measure} \to \text{measurable function} \to \text{float}$$
