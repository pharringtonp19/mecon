# Microeconomics

!!! tldr "Overview"

    The aim of this lecture is to layout the aims and expectations of the course

## **Learning**

##### Viewpoint
Learning something new can be difficult for the following three reasons. 

1. It's not clear why you should care about the topic
2. It's not clear what aspect of the topic is really important 
3. It's not clear how the components that form the topic fit together 

This course is developed with this understanding in mind. 

##### Approach

??? Question inline end "Consider"

    What's something that you think you understand relatively well? How did you get to that level of understanding? We all learn differently so it can be helpful to reflect on how you learn best.


As a little bit of background, I am a notoriuously slow learner. I've found that things usually don't start to click for me until late October/early November, and really only begin to sink in after coming back to the material multiple times over the span of a few years. What this means is that, if your not understanding something, you have company. More to the point, though, this class will proceed slowly and emphasize the fundamentals. You may have had teachers in high school say something like "we're behind, so we need to get through this material quickly." That's not going to be our approach. The concepts that we will tackle in this semester will be used throughout your undergraduate career. We're going to take the time to learn them well, and in parcular, emphasize how new concepts build upon and relate to previous concepts.

## **Motivation**

##### Aim
The aim of this course is to help you think about complex problems in an intuitive and clear way. Economic issues and questions can get complex in a hurry. With multiple parties involved, and multiple time periods,  Economic problems can't generally be tackled by the machinery you learned in high school. Usually (but not always!), you'll need some additional tools in order to "chart" your solution path. The goal of this course is to introduce you to these tools and help you develop a conceptual understanding of them. Hopefully learn not only how to model economic behavior, but also why we're modeling it one way and not another. This conceptual understanding will allow you to approach new problems in an intuitive and productive fashion. 

##### Math/Computation
As a bit of background, many of these tools will have a mathematical/computational aspect to them. This is, of course, not a math or computation class, so we won't assume any familarity of these topics. 

##### Practical Result
The world/economic behavior is a fascinating subject. We'll spend almost all of our time this semester learning how to develop models so that we can beter study/understand this behavior. You can think of this course as smilair to a literature course you might have taken in high school. Where, instead of writing an essays, we're going to be writing economic models. Like an high school essay, the topic of these models will often be of your choice!
