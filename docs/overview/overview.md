## **Motivation**
Models are constructed in response to questions. The key word here is constructed, meaning that models are built. When you build something, the first question to ask is whether the thing you built is any good, whether it's useful. The usefulness depends largely on who the model is for. Perhaps you are writing down a model to help organize your thoughts. Then you may not need a complete model. Or, perhaps you are asked to help predict the effects of a some government policy such as [Right to Counsel](https://www.jud.ct.gov/HomeNotices/NoticeToTenants.html#:~:text=Right%20to%20Counsel%20%2D%20CT%20Judicial%20Branch&text=Public%20Act%2021%2D34%20created,loss%20of%20their%20housing%20subsidy.). Then you probably want to decide on who this policy might effect, think through how each party involved might respond, and suggest a range of possible outcomes.

The aim of this course is to help you learn to write down models so that you may be in a better position to suggest answers to questions of interest. You can think of this as a English class that you may have taken in high school where instead of writing an essay, we're going to be learning how to write down models. Like an high school essay, the topic of these models will be your choice!

## **Assessments**

<!-- There will be no tests/midterms in this course. In my experience, tests and midterms encourage an impresssive amount of "cramming" days before the test, with most of the material forgotten a few days after. I am not concerned by the fact that the material is forgotten. Most of the material in this course will be forgotten regardless of how you learned it. What's important to take away from this class though is an understanding of how to break down an idea (a model) into simpler parts, work on each part and then glue them back together. Cramming doesn't help with this, so no tests/midterms.  -->

We will have bi-weekly group assignments, two midterms and a final.


## **Teaching Philosophy**: 
Ideas are explained at the level of detail so as to enable composition (it should feel like you're [playing with legos](https://youtu.be/Jy5Jw8hNiAQ?t=464)). Based on my experience, I found this is best done by writing math on computer. Some people will consider this to be programming, but those people would be wrong. It's just writing math on a computer. On the first day of class, you will learn everything you need to know about writing math on the computer.
