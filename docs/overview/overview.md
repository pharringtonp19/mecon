# Microeconomics

## **Learning**
Learning something new can be difficult for the following three reasons. 

1. It's not clear why you should care about the topic
2. It's not clear what aspect of the topic is really important 
3. It's not clear how the components that form the topic fit together 

This course is structured with this understanding in mind. 

## **Motivation**
Models are constructed in response to questions. The key word here is constructed, meaning that models are built. When you build something, the first question to ask is whether the thing you built is any good, whether it's useful. The usefulness depends largely on who the model is for. Perhaps you are writing down a model to help organize your thoughts. Then you may not need a complete model. Or, perhaps you are asked to help predict the effects of a some government policy such as [Right to Counsel](https://www.jud.ct.gov/HomeNotices/NoticeToTenants.html#:~:text=Right%20to%20Counsel%20%2D%20CT%20Judicial%20Branch&text=Public%20Act%2021%2D34%20created,loss%20of%20their%20housing%20subsidy.). Then you probably want to decide on who this policy might effect, think through how each party involved might respond, and suggest a range of possible outcomes.

The aim of this course is to help you learn to write down models so that you may be in a better position to suggest answers to questions of interest. You can think of this as a English class that you may have taken in high school where instead of writing an essay, we're going to be learning how to write down models. Like an high school essay, the topic of these models will be your choice!

## **Assessments**

#### Homework 
We will have **weekly** homework that will alternate every other week in nature. 
In one week, you will be asked to complete a problem set. In the next week, working in groups you will provide provide commentary/ analysis on a current event making use of the tools that we have learned thus far in the semester. 

#### Midterms
We will have two midterms that will cover problems which will be similair in nature to the problem sets. 

#### Final 
The final will be similair in nature to the written response homework. You will be given an article or two about a specific issue and be asked to provide your own analysis making use of the tools learned in this class.

## **Teaching Philosophy**:
This is a critical thinking course. We want to help you develop the tools that will enable you to think about complex problems/ issues in a systematic and complete way. We do this by tackling problems at varying levels of abstraction, emphasising concepts at the level of detail so that they can be composed.
