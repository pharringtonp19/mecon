Hopefully, by the end of this, it will be clear why I think so. We're going to learn how to model strategic interactions between agents with limited information. That is we're going to try to model/predict how agents will act when the outcome of interest depends on both their actions and of other agents around them. The term agent is synonymous in this context with the term \"decision-maker\". We'll begin by introducing a relatively general way to model strategic interactions and then illustrate how the toy examples covered in the textbook correspond to a very particular case of the framework. The assumption here is that you have already seen games like Prisoners-delimma and the like from your introduction to microeconomics class. Framework We're going to consider the model of an agent and an environment . An agent, as mentioned above is a decision maker, (i.e. one who makes decisions). The environment cab be thought of as the state of the world together with the mechanism that generates new state of the world. update :: state -> action -> state -> reward For the moment, we're going to focus on environments where the state of the world doesn't matter. Which means we can simpify the above function to: update :: action -> reward Two Modeling Options Which one should we choose? Hopefully the question that you are asking yourself right now is, how do we incorporate the actions of other agents into this framework? There's essentially two ways, we can think of them as \"silently\" comming into the update function, or we can think of them as a component of the state, and that therefore the state is only partially observable. We're going to use the latter framework with the understanding that the each agent has the same observable state, but different true states. Example Nash Equilibirum Under our framework, a Nash equilibrium is a situation where no one would be better off by choosing a different action assuming everyone kept theirs (there is no incentive to deviate) Underactuated How should we think about underactuated in a discrete time system? $$\\text{new_state} = f(\\text{state}, \\text{action})$$","title":"Game Theory"},{"location":"chapters/Game%20Theory/#introduction","text":"I think the most important statement in the chapter is \"suppose we consider round 10\".

We'll yes and no. To start with, in order to build a model you need to have some understanding of the issue/topic of interest so as to determine which aspects of reality don't need to be faithfully captured by the model. But in addition to that, an Economic model without any data is simply the the result of composing several of your own ideas together. So, does it help you understand an Economic reality, or does the act of creating a model help you better understand your own thoughts on the Economic reality? Market Equilibrium: Where Supply Meets Demand Let's say that we're back in the Spring of 2020 and that we're working for Petco, a company that produces dog food. Our manager comes to us and asks us to model how a shutdown for several months might affect the dog food market. We decide to approach this in three steps. First we'll model the demand for dog food, then well model the supply before putting these pieces together to get a rough picture/understanding of the entire market. Demand We know that quantity demanded is a function of price. When price increase, the quantity demanded falls. $$Q_{\\text{demand}} = f(\\text{price})$$ With the pandemic, the relationship remains, but we now want to think about how social distancing and remote work might affect the demand for dog food. To do so, we augment our demand function to include the months of the pandemic as an argument. $$\\begin{aligned} Q_{\\text{dogs}} &= g(\\text{price}, \\textrm{months}) \\\\ Q_{\\text{dog_food}} &= f(\\text{price}, \\textrm{months}) \\\\ f(\\text{price}, \\textrm{months}) &= h(g(\\text{price}, \\textrm{months}) , \\text{price})\\end{aligned}$$ def q_dog ( price_dog_food , months ): return 10 - price_dog_food + months for i in range ( 1 , 12 , 2 ): xs = jnp . linspace ( 1 , 12 , 100 ) ys = partial ( q_dog , months = i )( xs ) plt . plot ( xs , ys , label = i ) plt . title ( 'Price of Dog' , loc = 'left' , size = 14 ) plt . xlabel ( 'Quantity of Dogs' , size = 14 ) plt . legend ( frameon = False , title = 'Months in Pandemic' , ncol = 2 ) plt . show () def q_dog_food ( price_dog_food , months ): num_dogs = q_dog ( price_dog_food , months ) return 120 + 0.5 * num_dogs + months for i in range ( 1 , 12 , 2 ): xs = jnp . linspace ( 1 , 12 , 100 ) ys = partial ( q_dog_food , months = i )( xs ) plt . plot ( xs , ys , label = i ) plt . title ( 'Price of Dog Food' , loc = 'left' , size = 14 ) plt . xlabel ( 'Quantity of Dog Food' , size = 14 ) plt . legend ( frameon = False , title = 'Months in Pandemic' , ncol = 2 ) plt . show () What if ...

Introduction Like very few people who I interact with on a daily basis, I find the NBA offseason exilarating. As I am writing this sentence now in early July, Kevin Durant's future is still up in the air. Will he stay in Brooklyn? Will he stay with Kyrie? Could he possibly end up with the team up North? I find the inherent uncertainty of this event exciting. It gives plausibility to the thought of seeing Kevin Durant run pick-in-rolls with Ja Morant, or stretching the court with another long wing in Brandom Ingram. On the flip side, when I read articles regarding the current health of wall street, when I see headlines of an oncomming recession, it is easy to feel moments of anxiety. As we can all atest to, uncertainty can be both exilarating or debilitating depending on the context. Our task as Economist is to drain the emotion. We simply want to incorporate uncertainty into our Economic models to enhance them. Approach When people look at how difficult a topic is to learn, they might start by considering the number of elements in the topic. I might be wrong about this, but I believe this rough heuristic shapes how many people teach classes on statistics and probability. If you can reduce the number of ideas that a student has to consider the easier it should be to learn, i.e. the less overwhelmed they are. I buy the point that it's important to introduce material in a way so as to decrease the likelihood of overwhelming students (that's why we're starting so early in the semester with probability - we're going to introduce it piece by piece), but I would push back on the idea that having fewer elements to learn makes the topic easier to understand. Learning a new topic can be difficult for the following three reasons. (1) It can be hard to understand why you should care about the topic (2) It can be hard to understand which aspects of the topic are important and which are just details and (3) It can be hard to understand how the components of the topic fit together. With this understanding in mind, I believe introducing additional components can be helpful it if enables students to better compose ideas. That is, if the addition details allows students to better understand how ideas relate to each others. I think this is the key to understanding probability theory. Understanding the fundamentals will make it easier/ simpler to see how things relate to each other. If you never understand the fundamentals you'll simply have a collection of ideas in your head, which will be harder to keep track of and harder to work with in practice. Probability Space We'll start by introducing a probility space. We want to capture a lack of information, a lack of knowledge about some aspect of the world. $$\\begin{aligned}\\big( \\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P}) \\end{aligned}$$","title":"Introduction to Uncertainty"},{"location":"chapters/chapter2/#motivating-quote-robert-gallagher","text":"``The big problem in probability theory and particularly stochastic processes is not so much how do you solve well-posed problems.
